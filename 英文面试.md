# 自我介绍
Good morning, my name is Zhangfenghua. It's really a great honor to have this opportunity for a interview, i'd like to answer whatever you may raise, and I hope i can make a good performance today. Now i will introduce myself briefly. I graduated with a master's degree in communication and information system from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

During my last job, I was mainly responsible for the ToB business line where I drived the team to shift from PHP to the separation of front and back ends which eventually standardize the workflow and improve the development efficiency.

At the same time, I also participated in the group's low-code co-construction project and independently completed the design and development of the visual expression editor which made it possible for non-technical personnel to describe logic.

My experience in the past three years has built up my proficiency in the front-end development and I am conscientious and meticulous in my work. I believe my experience and passion will be a great asset to your team.

That's all. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

In order to standardize the development process and improve the development efficiency,  I promoted the front end team to move from php to front end separation. In addition, the whole project has also achieved good results from the product perspective. Since its launch, the overall promoting rate has increased by 700%
